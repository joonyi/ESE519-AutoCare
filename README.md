# ICU in a Bag - AutoCare

List of hardware in the system

1. Arduino Mega 2560    
2. Mbed LPC1786         
3. Touch Screen 3.2'    
4. Flow Rate Sensor    
5. Heart Rate Sensor

Heart rate sensor give information to Arduino which receives input from touch screen. From the heart rate information and input from the user, Arduino will communicate with mbed which will control the motor to move syringe automatically to give prescribed dosage. Flow rate sensor is a feedback to control the dosage.

In short, the intervention device shall be able to communicate with microcontroller and give dosage with a set of rules program by the user.
